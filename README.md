#Introduction to Rosalind Sassoon#
<h2>Welcome Sharon</h2>
<p>My name is Rosalind. I live in Los Angeles.  I used to live in OC quite a few years ago. Actually I called it OC before the TV show. When the show came out my friends told me I could no longer call it OC! 
</P>
<p>I currently work FT in group travel but am planning to make a career change to UX/UI. I am passionate about efficiencies and effectiveness. As a lifehacker I'm always looking for techniques and strategies to efficiently and effectively manage daily activities.  I often come across websites that are counter-intuitive and would love to help companies develop intuitive sites both mobile and desktop.
<p>I am pretty green with regards to coding. Although I have done the pre-work+ I was not always sure why we were advised to put the coding in the specified sequence. I used Dreamweaver several years ago to build a couple of simple websites but never learned HTML. I am looking forward to learning HTML5.  
<p/>
<p>I am very impressed with your kbb website design. I am excited to have you as my mentor. I have been complemented on my sense of style/ interior design but I am NOT a designer - so I am looking forward to learning about "UX design" and looking forward to learning all about UX/UI as well as how I can make this a successful career change. I hope to go out there and make my mark:)
<p/>
Thanks for reading!</p>

Why when I do NOT have a blank row above Table Test does the "table test" duplicate under "thanks for reading"?
